       "\n",
       "**Project Mariner** is a research prototype by Google DeepMind, launched in December 2024. It automates web-based tasks like online shopping and information retrieval, aiming to boost user productivity. Operating as a Chrome extension, it interprets complex goals and navigates websites to execute tasks, with user oversight. As of May 2025, Project Mariner is available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US and is integrated into the Gemini API and Vertex AI. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mariner?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**Manus** is an autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Pte. Ltd., launched on March 6, 2025. It performs complex real-world tasks without continuous human guidance, including writing and deploying code. In December 2025, Meta Platforms acquired Manus, valuing the deal between US$2-3 billion. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**OpenClaw** is a free and open-source autonomous AI assistant software developed by Peter Steinberger, released in November 2025. It executes tasks via large language models, using messaging platforms as its main user interface. OpenClaw gained popularity in late January 2026 and, on February 14, 2026, Steinberger announced joining OpenAI, with the project moving to an open-source foundation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw?utm_source=openai))\n",
