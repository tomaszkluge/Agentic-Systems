      "\n",
      "High-level turnaround objectives (12 months)\n",
      "1. Stop client churn and stabilize revenue within 90 days.\n",
      "2. Launch 2–3 AI-augmented productized offerings and 1 managed-service capability within 6 months.\n",
      "3. Re-skill core consulting staff and build an AI/analytics capability to support scaled delivery within 12 months.\n",
      "4. Achieve positive EBITDA improvement and restore pipeline velocity by month 12.\n",

      "3. Become AI-native: adopt AI internally to increase efficiency and create differentiated client offerings (human + AI workflow).\n",
      "4. Reskill and reconfigure talent: create T-shaped consultants (domain + AI/tooling) and build small multidisciplinary squads.\n",
      "5. Market repositioning & partnerships: lead with ROI-focused case studies, partner with cloud/AI providers and niche AI boutiques.\n",

      "Executive summary\n",
      "- Problem: Clients are switching to AI automation (tools/products) that replace parts of traditional consulting work. That erodes revenue, pipeline and perceived relevance.\n",
      "- Goal: Stabilize revenue, stop client churn, and rebuild a differentiated, sustainable services/offering model where the firm adds value that AI alone cannot.\n",
      "- Approach: Three-phase turnaround (Stabilize 0–3 months; Rebuild 3–12 months; Grow & Scale 12–36 months) built on five strategic pillars: client centricity & retention, productized outcome offerings, AI-native advisory + delivery, talent & operating model, and partnerships & IP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis (what to check immediately)\n",
      "- Client churn analysis: Which segments, services, and clients left and why (cost, speed, perceived equivalence of AI)?\n",
      "- Service mapping: Which consulting tasks are commoditized by AI vs. which remain high-value (strategy, leadership, change, complex data integration, regulatory)?\n",
      "- Revenue concentration & pipeline health.\n",
      "- Cost base & utilization of consultants.\n",
      "- Current AI skills, tools, accelerators, proprietary IP.\n",
      "- Sales messaging: Are you selling outputs (reports, PPTs) or outcomes (revenue, cost, risk reduction)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategic objectives (90 days / 12 months)\n",
      "- 90 days: Stop urgent churn, stabilize cash flow, get leadership alignment, quick-win AI-enabled offerings.\n",
      "- 12 months: Launch 3-5 differentiated, outcome-based service lines; retrain top talent; sign new contracts with outcome or subscription pricing.\n",
      "- 24–36 months: Grow recurring revenue, expand IP, become a recognized AI + domain specialist in 1–2 verticals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five strategic pillars and concrete actions\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Client retention & win-back (Immediate)\n",
      "- Triage clients: segment by risk and lifetime value. Prioritize Top 20% and at-risk accounts.\n",
      "- Outreach program: executive-to-executive win-back calls, present a short “AI impact and recovery” plan and free diagnostics/workshop.\n",
      "- Offer immediate value: free or discounted AI-readiness assessment and a 4-week proof-of-value (PoV) focused on a revenue/cost/risk metric.\n",
      "- Contract tactics: short-term renewal discounts tied to pilots or outcome guarantees to lock revenue while you rebuild offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Productize outcomes (Short—Medium term)\n",
      "- Move from time-and-materials / slide decks to productized services: “AI-enabled forecasting as a service,” “Regulatory AI compliance program,” “Sales opportunity prediction + remediation.”\n",
      "- Define standardized scopes, packaging, pricing, SLAs and KPIs.\n",
      "- Launch managed services/subscription models for recurrent work. This de-risks clients and creates predictable revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) AI-native advisory + delivery (Short—Medium term)\n",
      "- Create an internal AI Center of Excellence (CoE) that combines domain experts, ML engineers, data engineers and experience designers.\n",
      "- Offer integrated solutions: strategy + data platform + change management. Sell outcomes (e.g., X% cost reduction, Y% increase in sales conversion).\n",
      "- Build accelerators: templates, pre-trained models, connectors to popular vendors (OpenAI, Azure, AWS, Snowflake, etc.) to shorten time-to-value.\n",
      "- Governance & ethics practice: clients need help with model risk, compliance and trustworthy AI—package this as a service.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Talent, organization & operating model (Immediate—Medium)\n",
      "- Rapid skills triage: identify high-potential consultants to retrain (data engineering, prompt engineering, AI product management, change leadership).\n",
      "- Training & certification plan (partner with vendors for bootcamps).\n",
      "- Realign delivery teams from project-centric to product/engagement squads (cross-functional pods with accountability for outcomes).\n",
      "- Incentives: shift compensation mix to reward subscription revenue, outcomes, client retention and IP reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Partnerships & IP (Medium)\n",
      "- Form alliances with 2–3 technology vendors (cloud providers, LLM/AI platforms, specialized vertical AI vendors). Get partner enablement, co-marketing, and preferential pricing.\n",
      "- Acquire or license vertical datasets or micro-IP where possible.\n",
      "- Consider small bolt-on acquisitions (AI product, vertical SaaS, specialized data engineering shop) if capital allows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase-based roadmap\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 1 — Stabilize (0–3 months)\n",
      "- Actions: client triage & outreach; freeze non-essential hiring; quick Win PoV offers; pricing concessions tied to pilots; form leadership turnaround team.\n",
      "- Deliverables: list of at-risk clients, 10–15 PoV offers, immediate cost savings plan, CoE charter.\n",
      "- Metrics: churn rate stopped, pipeline stabilized, PoV conversion rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 2 — Rebuild (3–12 months)\n",
      "- Actions: productize 3–5 service offerings; launch CoE and 2–3 client pilots; retrain top 20% staff; set new sales playbook and marketing (thought leadership on AI + domain).\n",
      "- Deliverables: packaged offerings, managed services SLAs, partnerships with 1–2 vendors, first recurring contracts.\n",
      "- Metrics: % revenue from new offerings, MRR from subscriptions, utilization, customer NPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 3 — Scale & Grow (12–36 months)\n",
      "- Actions: expand vertical specialization, invest in IP (accelerators, data assets), pursue strategic hires or acquisitions, global go-to-market expansion.\n",
      "- Deliverables: repeatable playbooks, marketplace assets, recognized brand in chosen verticals.\n",
      "- Metrics: ARR, gross margin increase, client retention LTV, ROI on CoE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go-to-market and pricing\n",
      "- Messaging: shift from “we do analysis” to “we guarantee X outcome” and “we integrate AI safely into operations.”\n",
      "- Sales plays: industry-specific AI transformation plays, fast PoV plays, compliance & governance play.\n",
      "- Pricing: hybrid models — upfront AI assessment + subscription for managed services + outcome-based bonus. Example: 20% upfront, monthly fee, and a success fee tied to agreed KPI uplift.\n",
      "- Case studies: document PoVs into short case studies for sales enablement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operations & delivery\n",
      "- Standardize delivery templates and reusable code/modules to lower cost-per-project.\n",
      "- Implement DevOps and MLOps practices: CI/CD for models, monitoring, retraining schedules.\n",
      "- Quality & compliance: run model risk assessments and client-facing runbooks for incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talent & culture\n",
      "- Fast-track \"AI Fellows\" program: upskill 5–10 client-facing leaders to become AI-practice leads who can sell PoVs.\n",
      "- New roles: AI product manager, prompt engineer, ML engineer, data engineer, change lead.\n",
      "- Cultural change: reward client outcomes and IP reuse; embed learning and experimentation time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partnerships & ecosystem\n",
      "- Tech partners for infrastructure and models (negotiate go-to-market support).\n",
      "- Boutique specialists (NLP, computer vision) to augment capacity without heavy hiring.\n",
      "- Universities / labs for advanced R&D if long-term differentiation desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financials & investment priority (rules of thumb)\n",
      "- Prioritize revenue-stabilizing actions first (client retention, PoVs).\n",
      "- Initial investment range: 3–8% of annual revenue to build CoE, accelerate sales, and run pilots (adjust to cash position).\n",
      "- Reallocate existing spend: pause low-margin engagements and non-strategic initiatives.\n",
      "- Track payback: aim for PoV-to-paid-contract conversion in <6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "KPIs & OKRs (examples)\n",
      "- OKR (90 days): Reduce churn by 40% among top 50 clients. Key results: 50 executive win-back calls completed, 20 PoVs sold.\n",
      "- OKR (6 months): Launch three productized services with $X MRR. Key results: 3 contracts signed, CoE staffed, 2 published case studies.\n",
      "- KPIs to monitor: client churn, renewal rate, % revenue from subscriptions, PoV conversion rate, utilization, average deal size, gross margin by offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risks & mitigations\n",
      "- Risk: PoVs fail to convert — Mitigate: run very focused PoVs with clear, measurable KPIs and executive buy-in.\n",
      "- Risk: Talent defection — Mitigate: retain top billers with short-term incentives and clear retraining paths.\n",
      "- Risk: Cash constraints — Mitigate: prioritize high-ROI, low-capex pilots and use partner credits.\n",
      "- Risk: Competitive pressure from large players — Mitigate: focus on vertical specialization, regulatory know-how, and trusted client relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick 10-step action checklist (first 30 days)\n",
      "1. Convene leadership turnaround team and set weekly cadence.\n",
      "2. Run client churn analysis and list top 50 clients by risk/LTV.\n",
      "3. Launch executive outreach program for top accounts.\n",
      "4. Define 5 short PoV packages (2–4 week) with pricing and success metrics.\n",
      "5. Freeze non-essential hiring; reallocate training budget.\n",
