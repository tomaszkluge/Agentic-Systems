My name is Anand Swaminathan. I'm a technology leader and software engineer.
I love to travel and include hiking in all my travels, love the outdoors and love building things. I love reading about ancient civilizations and Egyptian civilization has held my fascination. Model Railroading is one of my hobbies. Ed Donner and I have one thing in common which is that I also hate the taste of cheese!
