It sounds like you're experiencing a significant change in the appearance of your nose, which can be concerning. First, I want to reassure you that there are many possible explanations for this symptom, and we will explore them together.

### Child-Friendly Explanation of Symptoms
When we see a change in size or shape of any part of our body, like your nose, it could be due to several reasons. Sometimes, it can be a result of swelling from an injury, an allergic reaction, or an infection. Other times, there may be underlying conditions that could require medical attention.

### Possible Conditions
1. **Allergic Reaction**: Swelling can occur due to allergies, especially if you've been exposed to something that irritates your skin or sinuses.
2. **Infection**: An infection, such as sinusitis or cellulitis, can also cause swelling in the nasal area.
3. **Trauma**: If there has been any recent bump or injury to your nose, this could lead to swelling.
4. **Other Medical Conditions**: While "Pinocchio disease" is a term often used in a playful context to refer to lying (which causes the nose to grow in the story), it’s important to note that it’s not a recognized medical condition. However, if this is about changes in growth or appearance, it’s best to consult a specialist.

### Next Steps
1. **Consult a Specialist**: Since the symptoms you're experiencing may require a closer examination, I recommend consulting a specialist. Given the nature of your symptoms, visiting a **neurologist** or a **neurosurgeon** may not be the most direct path unless there are neurological symptoms involved. Instead, a **dermatologist** or an **ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat)** specialist would be more appropriate for nasal concerns.
2. **Diagnostic Tests**: Depending on the specialist's evaluation, they may suggest imaging tests (like X-rays or CT scans) or allergy testing to determine the cause of the swelling.
3. **Treatment Plan**: Treatment will depend on the underlying cause identified by the specialist. This could range from medications for allergies or infections to other interventions if necessary.

Please ensure you communicate all your symptoms clearly to your caregiver and the specialist you choose to consult. They will be able to provide tailored advice and treatment based on a full assessment. Take care, and I hope you find relief soon!
